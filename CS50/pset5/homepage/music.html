                I can't live without music in my life. I listen to it while doing everything
                (e.g. homework, reading, eating, getting ready for the day, walking places, going to bed, well maybe not while sleeping... xD).
                Listening to music and singing in the shower is a daily routine.

                I sing! I sung in choir every year since I've been in school, and now here at Harvard, I am in two a capella groups: the Fallen Angels and Fusian. I can't wait to see what we do next!
            </p>
            <p>
                I listen to all kinds of music and have a playlist for almost everything: chill edm, edm, acoustic, indie, pop, piano, soundtracks, KPop, multiple vibes playlists.

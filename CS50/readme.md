This is the the entire workspace of my work from CS50, Introduction to Computer Science at Harvard, my first CS class, taken Fall 2018. (downloaded from the CS50 IDE). Nothing has since been edited from the original.

Notes:

- the instructions for all the assignments unfortunately were not saved/included.
- pset1 and pset2 were not coded or done within the CS50 IDE.
- "finance" was the final pset of the class, which combined many of the things we learned throughout the semester
- "project" contains the work of my final project (created and implemented independently)
  - see video_link.md in the project folder for the youtube link to the video I created explaining the process and result of my project.
  - project overview and details are contained within the folder "implementation"

# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I was thinking about creating a website that took input from users in some sort of survey, a series of rather abstract questions about their mood, or how life is going.
Then, I want to study word-color association and, from some colors database, automatically/systematically generate a screen of a few colors in response to the user's input, with a relevant inspirational quote.
I'm actually also interested in making some sort of random art generator, where a word is put into some program that performs some operations, eventually outputting a color pattern in corresepondence.
Or, I want to make a simple website that is to some extent a meaningful response to the frequent lamentation, "I'm not good at art."
Art is not a definite entity, and neither is a mindset, so perhaps creating something that allows anyone to be an artist?
I also just really want to a make a website for myself, i.e. about me with my interests, maybe art, travel, a blog, a store, and other general things about life, but I'm not sure this would work for a project like this.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

I plan on working by myself

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Are any of these ideas feasible? Too simple/too complex? And is there any general advice that might help me figure out how to start this project?

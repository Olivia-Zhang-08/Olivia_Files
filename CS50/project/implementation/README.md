My name is Olivia Zhang, and I am a freshman at Harvard College. Welcome to my CS 50 Final Project!

"Feelings of Color" is a emotion-color association project with two parts. The first part is data-collection via a Google Form and analysis with built-in Google Sheets functions.
The second part a web-based prototype emotion-color association tool, created based on the data-collected.

1) Data Collection:
To view the Google Form I created for data collection, see this link https://goo.gl/forms/DBbKSG8ZRgbxfwdq2. The responses from the forms were automatially collected in a Google Sheet,
on which I used built-in functions to analyze the data: For each color listed in the survey, I found the most associated emotion (among the given 9 basic emotions) with that color.
These were used in the website part of my project, which what you, the user, get to see.

2) Website:
The site is simple to navigate. When you use flask run in the CS 50 IDE to open the page, you are taken to the home page with an introduction of the project's basic underlying ideas.
Click on the "Find out" button to access the primary Form of the project.

On the Form page, you may select a color fromt the color picker in the center of the screen. All ranges of colors are there. Feel free to play around witht eh rainbow slider
or gradient square to find the exact oclor you are interested in. There is no specific prompt for the color. It an be a color you are feeling in the moment, a color you hate,
or a random color you are interested in seeing data for. Once you have selected the color, click "Choose", then hit the "Submit" button.

After submittig your color, you are taken to a results page showing the top 3 associated-emotion components of your color, based on the data I collected and you imput.
For more information on what the percents mean, see DESIGN.md in this repository.

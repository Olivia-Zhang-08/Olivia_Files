Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I spent a lot of time over the break thinking about how to plan my process, as well as thinking about the different methods and modifications I could or should make to feasibly do my project.
I spent a few hours doing some research on existing studies on word-color association to help me come up with my own data collection method. I made a Google form, which I then sent to various mailing lists asking for people to generously devote a minute of their time to complete my survey.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Once I have a solid set of data, I will call an ML module (e.g. logistic regression) from a Python API (e.g. the one from Orange, an open source ML/data vis software), then train the model to obtain a set of intercepts and coefficients for the model.
I will create a website where, the user-inputed emotion word is plugged into the model equation, and it will get the predicted color terms w/ their associated probabilities, which can in turn be ranked and associated with a color palette to present.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I needed to think a lot about how to do the data collection (google form vs. my own form), how to incorporate ML (using function widgets in Orange, or write Python code to implement them), and considering only using IDE or finding a web hosting service if possible.
I think I have cme up with a plan that I am both satisfied with and that is feasible to do, but likely I will still make many modifications along the way.

This contains code and other work I've done on projects in the past year and a half, compiled from different locations.

- Skills and concepts used in my CS50 work Fall 2018 include C, Python, html, css, javascript, SQL, and Flask.
- The data formatting folder contains what I used to format data in my CMU research Summer 2019, written in Python in Google Colab (in our team's shared folder). This was my first time learning how to use pandas, numpy, dataframes, etc.
- The data formatting folder also contains what I briefly did in my HGP advisory internship Jan. 2020 to help process some data for a larger Femtech market research project. 
- I've also included a powerpoint portfolio of my visual design-related projects.
